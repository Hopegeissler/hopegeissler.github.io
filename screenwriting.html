      <h2>Screenwriting</h2>
      <p>My very first class in college was an Intro to Screenwriting course and I fell in love with it instantly. I read the textbook on formatting scripts in two days because I found it fascinating. It wasn't until my TV Screenwriting course that I realized this is something I excelled at and could pursue as a future career. My preferred area of screenwriting is Sit Coms.</p>

      <h2>Journalism</h2>
      <p>I have taken numerous classes at the University of Miami covering skills in both broadcast and print journalism. I have learned how to gather information using public records and through developing my interviewing skills. I worked a ScreenRant for the summer of <time datetime="2021">2021</time> where I wrote lists on TV shows and movies. That job taught me how to multitask on multiple assignments, apply feedback accordingly, and how to pitch story ideas. </p>

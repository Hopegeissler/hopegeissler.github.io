      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>

      <p>My name is Hope Geissler and I am currently a senior at the University of Miami. I am studying Electronic Media and Film with a special interest in writing. I was an Executive Producer for Off The Wire which is the school's late night comedy show for a year where I won multiple awards for my work. Currently, I work for the University of Miami's Atheltic Department as a Production Assistant where I help broadcast Hurricane sports on the ACC Network. </p>

      <p>I spent a semester abroad in Rome, Italy. While I was there I traveled to 10+ countries and learned conversational Italian. Living abroad was truly a once in a life time experience and it taught me how to be adaptable and confident in myself. I studied art history extensively during the semester as well as learning the ins and outs of Italian culture. My favorite places that I visited were Tromso, Norway and Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>
      <p>I am originally from West Chester, PA and I love all things Pennsylvania including Wawa and soft pretzels. Go Philly sports!</p>

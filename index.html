    <aside id="abroad">
      <p>I spent a semester abroad in Rome, Italy. While I was there i traveled to 10+ countries and learned conversational Italian. Living abroad was truly a once in a life time experience and it taught me how to be adaptable and confident in myself. I studied art history extensively during the semester as well as learning the ins and outs of Italian culture. My favorite places that I visited were either Tromso, Norway or Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Hope Geissler and I am currently a senior studing at the University of Miami. I am studying Electronic Media with a minor in Film. I am planning on graduating in May of 2024. I plan on using my degree to write sitcoms and hopefully get one of my own shows produced.</p>

    <h2>My Hometown</h2>
    <p>I am from West Chester, Pennsylvania which is about 30 to 45 minutes outside of Philadelphia. I am an avid Philly sports fan and can confirm that everything you see and hear about Philly fans is 100% true. I love watching the Phillies and the Eagles and very much enjoy watching people trying to climb the greased traffic poles after a Philly sports win.</p>

    <p>My favorite things about Philly:</p>

    </ol>

    <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p>I am the youngest member of my family. I have a 23-year-old brother named Jake. He graduated with an MBA from Penn State and moved back home with his first real adult job. He is working to become a financial analyst for a company called Vangaurd. I have an 11-year-old portuguese water dog named Buddy. He works as a therapy dog for kids with disabilities. My dad, John, works for JP Morgan Chase and my mom, Tina, works at West Chester University as a librarian.</p>

          <p>The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from Spain in <time datetime="1579">1579</time>; during the 17th century, they became a leading seafaring and commercial power, with settlements and colonies around the world.</p>
          
          <p>After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed in <time datetime="1815">1815</time>. In <time datetime="1830">1830</time>, Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom.

          <p>A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> and the <abbr title="European Economic Community">EEC</abbr> (now the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) and participated in the introduction of the euro in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>.</p>

            <h3>Flag Description</h3>

              <p>The flag has three equal horizontal bands of red (bright vermilion; top), white, and blue (cobalt). It is similar to the flag of Luxembourg but the Luxembourg flag has a lighter blue and is longer.</p>
            
              <p>The colors were derived from those of William I, Prince of Orange, who led the Dutch Revolt against Spanish sovereignty in the latter half of the 16th century. The upper band on the flag was originally orange, but because the orange dye turned red over time, the red shade was eventually the permanent color. The banner is perhaps the oldest tricolor in continuous use.</p>

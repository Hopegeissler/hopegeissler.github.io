          <p>The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from Spain in <time datetime="1579">1579</time>; during the 17th century, they became a leading seafaring and commercial power, with settlements and colonies around the world.</p>
          
          <p>After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed in <time datetime="1815">1815</time>. In <time datetime="1830">1830</time>, Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War <data value="1">I</data> but suffered German invasion and occupation in World War <data value="2">II</data>.</p>
          
          <p>A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> and the <abbr title="European Economic Community">EEC</abbr> (now the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) and participated in the introduction of the euro in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>.</p>
          
          <p>In <time datetime="2010-10">October 2010</time>, the former Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands - Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities in the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of Sint Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as constituent countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>In <time datetime="2018-02">February 2018</time>, the Sint Eustatius island council (governing body) was dissolved and replaced by a government commissioner to restore the integrity of public administration. According to the Dutch Government, the intervention will be as "short as possible and as long as needed."</p>

            <h3>Flag Description</h3>

              <p>The flag has three equal horizontal bands of red (bright vermilion; top), white, and blue (cobalt). It is similar to the flag of Luxembourg but the Luxembourg flag has a lighter blue and is longer.</p>
            
              <p>The colors were derived from those of William I, Prince of Orange, who led the Dutch Revolt against Spanish sovereignty in the latter half of the 16th century. The upper band on the flag was originally orange, but because the orange dye turned red over time, the red shade was eventually the permanent color. The banner is perhaps the oldest tricolor in continuous use.</p>
